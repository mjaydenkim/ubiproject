  According to Andrew Yang's book, "The War on Normal People", on a study conducted by a Princeton psychologist and a Harvard economist, “...poor people and well-off people perform very similarly on tests of fluid intelligence, a generalized measurement that corresponds to IQ. But if each group was forced to consider how to pay an unexpected car repair bill of $3,000 just before taking the test, the poor group would underperform by the equivalent of 13 IQ points, almost one full standard deviation.” (Yang) The mindset of scarcity takes a huge hit on people's mindsets, happiness, and health. A recent experiment was just conducted in Finland where 2000 random, unemployed Finns throughout the country were provided with about $630 USD per month. According to an article published by the New York Times about the experiment, "Sini Marttinen, 36, a former I.T. consultant, had been unemployed for nearly a year before “winning the lottery,” as she described the trial. Her basic income gave her enough confidence to open a restaurant with two friends. “I think the effect was a lot psychological,” she said." The UBI gave her the confidence to open up a restauraunt, a type of work that is very important but often put by the wayside in the economy. According to Bloomberg, the experiment reported that:
  * 58.2% of people had a strong confidence in their future compared with 46.2% of the control group
  * 55.4% of people had a strong or good perceived health compared with 46.2% of the control group
  * 56.1% of people believed they would find a job within the next 12 months compared with 44.8% of the control group
