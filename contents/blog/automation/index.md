    According to a paper published by two Oxford professors, Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, 47% of American jobs are at high risk of being automated by the mid-2030s. That time will come faster than we think. Jobs are already being displaced- think about the new self-checkout counter you saw at your local Safeway that replaced a few checkout workers, or how your local Main Street shops and even big chains like Toys-R-Us are falling due to the rise of online e-commerce, led by Amazon and Walmart, and taking down jobs with them. Robots are coming, and they're coming fast. When the average person thinks of job displacement by automation, they think of robot overlords, controlling our every move and forcing us into submission. However, this isn't actually how the "Great Displacement", as coined by Andrew Yang, would pan out- it'd be way more subtle but still devastating. And most people think of something in the future- as stated earlier, it's happening now, and will happen at greater rates in the very near future. Here are some jobs that are at great risk of being automated away in the future:
    * Taxi driving and long-haul truck driving (truck driving is the most common job in 29 states, according to a study done by NPR in 2017)
    * Customer service/office assistants (think about the bots that pick up the phone when you call a business, or Google Duplex)
    * Warehouse workers (Amazon has more than 100,000 robots working in its warehouses and can easily replace more humans if it is deemed helpful to them)
    * Assembly line manufacturing (and manufacturing in general)
    * Retail and customer interaction jobs (Cashiers, baggers, retail helpers, inventory, etc...)
    * Writers (They can already write coherent, grammatically correct news articles on basic information like stock prices)
    * Food prep/serving (Some restaurants are starting to introduce robots to serve food and behind-the-scenes, and screens are sometimes used to order as opposed to having hosts)
