description: Ths rebuttal will cover many different arguments against UBI, especially Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend. 
---

* People will stop working due to their basic income. 
  * The income of $12,000 a year is barely enough to live in many places and not enough to afford anything beyond the very basics. To get by with a plan like Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend would require moving to a very cheap area of the country and barely getting by- not indulging in any luxuries at all. To add, research on cash transfer programs has repeatedly shown that the only people that work less when given direct cash were moms and kids in school. In some cases, people even work more! 

* A UBI would cause rampant inflation.
  * Andrew's plan for UBI would use money mostly already in the economy. Inflation is based on changes in the supply of money, and the Freedom Dividend would have minimal changes in the supply of money since it would be mostly funded by a Value-Added Tax (or VAT). Some companies may increase their prices, and the VAT would also slightly increase prices. However, technology would continue to decrease the price of many goods like clothing, media, and consumer electronics, and competition will keep prices down. 

* We can't pay for something like that!
  * We actually can. The Freedom Dividend would be paid for by a combination of things, including a tax on big companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, cost savings on things like incarceration and homelessness services since people will be stronger and healthier due to the Freedom Dividend, a Value-Added Tax at half the European level, and new revenue from the economical benefits that the Freedom Dividend would provide. 

* Wouldn't the Value-Added Tax get passed onto consumers, cancelling out the $1000 extra dollars received from the UBI?
  * The Value-Added Tax that Andrew proposes (10%) exempts many items, like groceries and clothing (all "staple items"). Also, someone would have to buy a lot of non-exempted items to cancel out the value of the UBI. Considering the level of 10% that Andrew proposes, a single individual would have to purchase $120,000 worth of items per year before the price of the VAT spent that year reached the level of money received that year by the Freedom Dividend. Most people aren't spending nearly this much money. 

* Wouldn't people simply spend money on things like drugs?
  * According to an article published by the New York Times about a study done about the addictiveness of drugs like crack, "'Eighty to 90 percent of people who use crack and methamphetamine don’t get addicted,' said Dr. Hart, an associate professor of psychology. 'And the small number who do become addicted are nothing like the popular caricatures.'.. 'They didn’t fit the caricature of the drug addict who can’t stop once he gets a taste,' Dr. Hart said. 'When they were given an alternative to crack, they made rational economic decisions.'" (Tierney). As this study shows, many people would actually put this money toward more rational things like even trying to reduce their drug or alcohol abuse. With greater economic security, people can make decisions much more logically, as was shown in the health-related section of this site. 

* Isn't this socialism or communism?
  * Communism is, by definition, a movement to create a social order based upon shared ownership of production. Socialism nationalizes the means of production (the government would sieze large companies). The Freedom Dividend involves neither of these ideas and actually boosts a capitalist economy. 
  
 * Couldn't you just retrain the people who lost their jobs?
  * This would be a great idea, however retraining hasn't worked in the past. A program program run by the federal government, the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), for retraining displaced manufacturing workers saw only 37% of the workers they trained working in the field they were trained for.
