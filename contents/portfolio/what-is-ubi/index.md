## What is Universal Basic Income?
Universal Basic Income is a type of social security in which the government provides periodic cash to every citizen individually and unconditionally in the governed population regardless of income, work, or class. The idea has been touted by Thomas Paine at the founding of the country, Richard Nixon (who later turned against it), Abraham Lincoln, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Andrew Yang who is a Democrat running for president in 2020. It has been tested in many areas, including in Stockton, California, Kenya, Finland, India, and Canada. The idea has been growing steam, as the rise of automation have made people look at it again. 

## Why is it relevant now?
Automation has been displacing jobs and will continue to displace jobs- according to a study done by the Obama administration, 62% of American jobs may be at risk of being automated away, including 83% of jobs that make less than 20 dollars per hour, wtihin the next 10-20 years. The idea has been risen by many as a way to help combat the rise of automation in our society. At the 2017 World Government Summit, Elon Musk was interviewed and said, “There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better... I think some kind of universal basic income is going to be necessary. The output of goods and services will be extremely high. With automation there will come abundance. Almost everything will get very cheap. I think we’ll end up doing universal basic income. It’s going to be necessary." 

## What is Andrew Yang's plan?
Andrew Yang's centerpiece policy is called the "Freedom Dividend". It would put $1000 a month into the hands of every American over the age of 18. Someone's work status or social status will not affect how much money they recieve from the Freedom Dividend.
